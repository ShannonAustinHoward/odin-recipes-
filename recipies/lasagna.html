        <h1>Best Vegetable Lasagna</h1>
        <img src="../img/best-vegetable-lasagna-recipe-3-550x824.webp" alt="Best Veggie Lasagna">

        <p>I set out to create the best vegetable lasagna recipe. Here it is! This vegetarian lasagna is cheesy (of course), 
        and loaded with vegetables, spinach and a simple tomato sauce.</p>

        <p>If you have any meatless-meal skeptics in your life, this lasagna will change their mind. I’m sure of it.</p>

        <p>This lasagna is based on my spinach artichoke lasagna on the blog and the roasted eggplant lasagna in my cookbook. 
        I love those less-conventional vegetarian lasagnas.</p>

        <p>Yet, I wanted to offer a classic vegetable lasagna suitable for holidays and weeknights, and this is it. 
        The tomato sauce is the same across all three recipes, but the vegetables vary.</p>

        <p>For this recipe, you’ll chop bell pepper, zucchini and carrot into very small pieces and sauté them until they’re 
        nice and golden on the edges. That caramelization brings out so much more flavor. Then, add spinach to the skillet 
        and cooked it down for a few minutes so it doesn’t get too soggy.</p>
