        <h1>Loaded Veggie Nachos</h1>

        <p>My ideal nachos are topped with golden, bubbling cheese, not drizzled with nacho cheese sauce 
        that often goes cold in three minutes. I prefer a combination of two cheesesâ€”cheddar, for maximum 
        flavor and golden edges, and Monterey Jack, for its more melty and creamy texture.</p>
