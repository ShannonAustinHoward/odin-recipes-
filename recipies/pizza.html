        <p>The trick with loaded veggie pizzas, as many pizza shops seem to forget, is 
            that they require a few extra minutes in the oven to develop full flavor and structure. 
            Don’t stop baking until the cheese is deeply golden in spots. Otherwise, you might end up 
            with floppy pizza that doesn’t live up to its true potential.</p>
